**Clone and run for a quick way to see an Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application that opens a new window and switch focus from the newly created window to the main window.


A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
